# Device app download

Place the **Concertina Device** Android APK here so the device-connect page can offer it for download.

- Build the APK from `concertina-device-app` (see that folder’s README).
- Copy the built APK (e.g. `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) to this folder as `concertina-device.apk`.

Alternatively set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVICE_APP_DOWNLOAD_URL` to a full URL where the APK is hosted.
